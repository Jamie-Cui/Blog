Iâ€™m an Algorithm Engineer at Ant Group. My research interests mostly in the area of secure computation (which is a subfield of cryptography), and I am currently particularly interested in lattice and building blocks such as private information retrieval (PIR).

Before I work at Ant Group, I graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 2018, and I was fortunate to be supervised by Dr Myrto Arapinis. My thesis is ``A bitcoin wallet implementation using trusted execution environments''.
