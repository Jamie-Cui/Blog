Iâ€™m an Algorithm Engineer at Ant Group. My research interests are mostly in the area of secure computation (which is a subfield of cryptography), and I am currently interested in lattice and cryptography primitives such as PSI, PIR, FSS, etc..

Before I work at Ant Group, I graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 2018, and I was fortunate to be supervised by Dr Myrto Arapinis. My thesis is "A Bitcoin Wallet Implementation using Trusted Execution Environments".

I maintain an awesome list for secure computation papers (including MPC, lattice, DP, etc.) at: [https://github.com/Jamie-Cui/awesome-secure-computation](https://github.com/Jamie-Cui/awesome-secure-computation)
